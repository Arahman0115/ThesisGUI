## Functionality Overview:
### The pharmacogenomics software system traverses the PharmGKB database to fetch drug conflicts based on a patient's prescribed medication and genetics.

## Verification Queue:
### When a drug prescribed to a patient matches with a drug conflict from their drug review table, it populates the ### verification queue.
### This queue serves as a notification to pharmacists, indicating potential conflicts between prescribed medication and the patient's genetics.

## Contact Queue:
### If the prescriber denies the prescription due to identified conflicts, it gets sent to the contact queue.
### In the contact queue, prescribers are presented with the patient's drug review and conflicts, enabling them to review the information and determine the best course of action for patient care.
